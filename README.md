# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview
In this site you can publish pictures about explorations around the World. The example shows Jacques Cousteau, but you can change the name and subtitle
as you want. Just click in edit profile (the small pen beside the name) and it shows a form where you can change the information!!
Add new images and delete that you don't want. Change the names of images and like the images you love by clicking on the small heart bellow the image.

#### In this project I use Figma, the program where you can publish models and examples to be shared and work as a team, the link is bellow.
#### I use javaScript to apply the necessary changes in the forms, to insert images and put names and to like the images.
#### I use tinypng to transform the images and turn it smalest as I can to make the site more fast. The link for tinypng is bellow.
